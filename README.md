#Computer Science in JavaScript

Contains the basic fundamental data structures and algorithms that a front end engineer should know, written all in JavaScript.

Front end engineers need to know a mixture of technologies and methodologies from JavaScript, CSS, HTML to design patterns, MVC/MVVM, browser performance and responsive design to name but a few concepts.

However, Computer Science, and in particular data structures and algorithms are often ignored. While you may not use these on a day to day basis, user interfaces are becoming more complex and feature rich. 

Every front end engineer should be able to grasp the fundamentals of the following:

##Data Structures

* Binary Trees
* Doubly Linked Lists
* HashTables
* MaxHeaps
* Queues
* Singly Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Tries

##Sorting Algorithms

* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
